2. Open `index.html` in your web browser (no server needed).

## How to deploy to Netlify:
1. Create a new GitHub repository for your app.
2. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` to your GitHub repo.
3. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and click "New site from GitHub."
4. Connect your GitHub repo and click "Deploy Site."
5. Your site will be live on a Netlify domain.

## How to edit settings:
- **Switch to Demo Data**: You can toggle between demo and user data using the "Switch to Demo Data" button.
- **Upload Your Own Data**: Save your grave data as a JSON file in the `localStorage`. You can edit the `script.js` to change data formatting.
